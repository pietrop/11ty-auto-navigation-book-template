# Questions for them

At the end of the interview, there's often the inevitable, "Do you have any questions for me?". Which is easy to overlook if you have not spent a little time thinking about it. 

*Imagine you got the offer, congrats, you start tomorrow, what would you like to know?*

> I'm going to do a “5 Whys” on you. This is a technique for getting to the root of something. The idea is that you ask “why” about something, and then as a follow up to the response, you ask “why” about a certain aspect of it, and then repeat this a few more times.

> At the end of the interview, you should have some questions for me. Remember, we're having a conversation -- this is where you carry your part of it. Ask me about the culture here. Ask me if I like it. Ask me what I don't like. Ask me what the mission is? Ask me about my role in the mission. This is your turn at doing a “5 whys”. You should be figuring out if you want to work with me (or someone like me here).

- [ ]  Ask about the culture. Ask if they like it. Ask what they don't like.
- [ ]  Ask them what the mission is?
- [ ]  Ask them about their role in the mission.
- [ ]  "5 Whys"
