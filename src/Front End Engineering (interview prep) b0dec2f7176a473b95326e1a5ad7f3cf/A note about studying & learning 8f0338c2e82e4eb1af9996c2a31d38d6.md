# A note about studying & learning

Mix of deep comprehension to really understand concept.

Combined with repetition to remember and keep top of mind.

In a more or less structured approach. Keeping your own notes.

# Abstractions

In CS is easy to get overwhelmed by syntax and implementation details. However if you start by getting  a high level understanding to create a conceptual model, it’s much easier to then work your way down 

# Repetition

Some things you need to remember, others you need to understand.

Some things you’ll remember if you understand them.

Start by understanding then do daily repetition by exposing yourself to the concepts, ideas, details that are not sticking. Over time you’ll retain more of it.
