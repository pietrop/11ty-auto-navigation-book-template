1. DOMContentLoaded **-** gives you a feel for how long it took for the HTML to load so that the page can start rendering content.
2. Load - when all the resources are loaded ( resources are parsed and get acknowledged off before DOMContentLoaded)
3. **First Contentful Paint(FCP)**event relates to the moment when the first element from the DOM appears in the users’ browser.
4. **First Meaningful Paint** (deprecated)- the time it takes for a page’s primary content to appear on the screen.
5. **Speed Index** - shows how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated.
6. **First CPU Idle** (ready to interact, deprecated)- marks the first time at which the page’s main thread is quiet enough to handle input.
7. **Time To (fully) Interactive(TTI)**the amount of time it takes for the page to be fully interactive.
8. **First Input Delay (FID)**measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction.
9. Total Blocking Time - measures the total amount of time between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI) where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.
10. Largest Contentful Paint (2.5s)- measures when the largest content element in the viewport becomes visible. It can be used to determine when the main content of the page has finished rendering on the screen.
