> **RAIL model from Google**
RAIL is a user-centric performance model that provides a structure for thinking about performance.
RAIL is an acronym for “**Response, Animation, Idle and Load**.” The model categorises user interactions under these four domains. Users have different expectations whenever they tap, click on or scroll over your various page elements. Therefore, the RAIL model measures each user interaction with different context-specific goals in mind.

1)**Response:** process events in under 50ms (100ms) 

- To ensure a visible response within 100 ms, process user input events within 50 ms. This applies to most inputs, such as clicking buttons, toggling form controls, or starting animations. This does not apply to touch drags or scrolls.
- Though it may sound counterintuitive, it’s not always the right call to respond to user input immediately. You can use this 100 ms window to do other expensive work, but be careful not to block the user. If possible, do work in the background.
- For actions that take longer than 50 ms to complete, always provide feedback.

2) **Animation**: produce a frame in 10 ms (frame within 10ms) 

- Produce each frame in an animation in 10 ms or less. Technically, the maximum budget for each frame is 16 ms (1000 ms / 60 frames per second ≈ 16 ms), but browsers need about 6 ms to render each frame, hence the guideline of 10 ms per frame.
- Aim for visual smoothness. Users notice when frame rates vary.

3) **Idle**: maximize idle time (use idle time, 50ms) 

- Maximize idle time to increase the odds that the page responds to user input within 50 ms.

4) **Load**: deliver content and become interactive in under 5 seconds

- When pages load slowly, user attention wanders, and users perceive the task as broken. Sites that load quickly have longer average sessions, lower bounce rates, and higher ad viewability.
