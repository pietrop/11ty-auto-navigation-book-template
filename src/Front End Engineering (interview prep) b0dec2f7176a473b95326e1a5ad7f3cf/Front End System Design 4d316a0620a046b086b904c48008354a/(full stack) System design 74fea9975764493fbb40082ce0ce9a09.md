# (full stack) System design

# Summary

Full stack system design, should in theory be out of scope for the front end system design interview. But is not uncommon that the interviewer might have full stack experience, and might test the limit of your architecture and backend knowledge. So it doesn't hurt to have a high level understanding of some of these concepts.

In theory you shouldn't need this. Front End System design should be distinct enough from full stack/back end system design. But it doesn't hurt to have a broad overview and awareness just in case.
