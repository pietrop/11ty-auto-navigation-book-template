# Optimistic UI

eg in a chat app: when a user sends a message. And instead of waiting for the server response to acknowledge, we show the message they sent in the UI to remove UI lag.

> Optimistic UI aims to show the final state of the UI before an operation is actually finished. This will appear snappier and more fluid to the user. One of the most prominent examples are chat-based apps, like Messages, Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. When you send a message, it is immediately shown in the chat, even though it is not yet sent through the network. It may take some time to send it, especially if you have a slow internet connection, so you’re shielding the user from “the waiting experience”.
