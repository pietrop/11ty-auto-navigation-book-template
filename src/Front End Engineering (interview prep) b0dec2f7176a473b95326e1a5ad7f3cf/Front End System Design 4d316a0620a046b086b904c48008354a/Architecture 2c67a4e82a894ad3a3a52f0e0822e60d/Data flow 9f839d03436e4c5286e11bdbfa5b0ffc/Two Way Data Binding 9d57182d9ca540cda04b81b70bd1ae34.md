# Two Way Data Binding

> Two-way data binding refers to sharing data between a component class and its template. If you change data in one place, it will automatically reflate at the other end. For example, if you change the value of the input box, then it will also update the value of the attached property in a component class.

> Two way data binding isn't bad because two way data binding is bad. Some people don't like two way data binding because what it does is, every time you use it, is create an implicit link in your codebase.
