# Front End Architecture design pattern

Most likely we can assume you'll be using React for your front end system design architecture. 

React is considered to be a library and not a framework, as is equivalent to the View in MVC. 

Is also common to use a pattern where you just use React, and have some of the parent components be responsible for fetching the data from the backend.

Possibly with react router, if it's a the SPA (single page application) that requires multiple view.

None the less, being able to mention other front end architecture patterns might be a good to know. eg MVC, MVVM, MVP. 

As well as other libraries and frameworks you might be familiar with, such as backboneJs, Vue, Angular, Ember, Rails, Django etc... if appropriate. In the context of trade off vs current choice.

Or NextJS.

As well as potentially Redux and/or the concept of immutable state. or `[useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)` in react hooks.
