# Framework

# Overview of the framework

A (tentative) framework that you can follow when doing your front end system design interview.

Front end system design interviews can be fairly unstructured. So this is a a (tentative) framework that you can follow when doing front end system design interview. To cover most of the ground the interviewer might be interested in. 

Most of these sections come from examples of front end system design interviews on blogs and youtube. 

For each you'll find a summary of what to cover, and example of the corresponding artefacts you'll need to produce (eg bullet point list, wirferames, diagram, json data structure etc..)

For more details you can go to the page for each section.

Here is worth mentioning that front end system design interviews are relatively new compare to the full stack once. Depending on who your interviewers are (eg they are front end, backend and/or full stack), the scope of the role and how the team is organized ( eg are you really just on the front end or are you expected to stretch into the backend a bit?) your front end system design interview might be a bit of a hybrid where some aspects of a system design interview might come up. But not to worry, will cover at the end will cover some concepts from (full stack) system design to be familiar with.

## Tooling

If you are doing this type of interview in a remote/online settings, these are some of the tooling that is often used. In some places you can choose and bring your own. Others might have a preferred one.

[Google Drawings - create diagrams and charts, for free.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/)

[Flowchart Maker & Online Diagram Software](http://draw.io/)

Another option is to use google doc, and add google drawing in for the various parts that require sketches and/ or diagram. This is closer to what I‚Äôve done in a real life setting.

## Overview of the sections

# 1. üóíÔ∏è Requirements gathering

And would include

# 2. üììDefine Scope + MVP

# 3. üï∂Ô∏è Data entities

# 4. ‚ôüÔ∏è API end points

This might include a conversation around network communication 

eg are you connecting to the backend via a REST API, web socket etc.. or are you using GraphQL etc...

# 5. üè† Client side components architecture

Might also include  

For more see

## 5.1 üè° Components Architecture - Wireframes

- Component architecture
- layout (sketch/wireframe - user flow/interaction)
- visually identify components on the page
- Presentational and Container Component
- Mention whether you'd need a design system (eg collaborating on a cross functional team etc..)

**Artefacts**

- Wireframe sketches
    - If an isolated component, eg a widget than just zoom in on it
    - otherwise pages/views, eg design YoutTube, Instagram, Twitter etc..
- eg sketch for a commenting functionality in a:

## 5.2 üå¥ Components Tree - diagram

- further Component tree
- highlighting the data flow
- and the fetch entry points (in the diagram)
- possible UI patterns, eg
    - Optimistic UI
    - List virtualization
    - Recursive lists (eg hackernews or reddit comment section)

**Artefacts**

- diagram
- eg

This could include

and 

# 6. üöÄ Optimization & performance

# 7.  üöì Accessibility

# 8. ü•ó  Testing Strategy

# 9.üïµÔ∏è Security

# 10. üè¢ Full Stack System design consideration

# Cheatsheet framework list

This list below is a summary of the above and it is something you can use on the day. By listing these points in a "virtual" post it note at the beginning of the interview. To walk your interviewer through how you are planning to approach the problem.

You should also make it clear that you are open to ver off into different direction at any points if they have questions or things they'd like to focus on.
