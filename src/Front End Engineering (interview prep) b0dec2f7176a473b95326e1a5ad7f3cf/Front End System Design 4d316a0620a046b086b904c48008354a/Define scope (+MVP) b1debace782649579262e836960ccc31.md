# Define scope (+MVP)

- identify part of the system to focus on
- eg core
    - Features
    - APIs
    - Interactions
    - Interfaces
- list of TODO(s)
    - ...
- list of NOT-TODO(s)
    - Eg AMP?
    - SEOs?
    - Offline support?

**Artefact**

- notes, eg (virtual) post it
- Two lists, one for TODO and one for NOT-TODO
- bullet points

> After understanding the problem, we need to decide what the scope is going to be. Well, we cannot design a perfect system because there will be limited time i.e only 45 mins to 1 hour. So we need to pick those parts in which we are more confident. Don’t do the parts that you are not good at.

- The scope cannot be a perfect service, but the core parts should appeal to an interviewer within 45 minutes.
- List up the **TODO** and **NOT-TODO**( Check with the Interviewer ). The NOT-TODO should be also listed down, to show that we are aware of the not-todo but due to time constraints, we will not be able to do that.

> What’s the volume of the service and how many team members.

## MVP( Minimum Viable Product)

> What is the MVP( Minimum Viable Product) — List of Core features like Core APIs, Core interactions, and Core interfaces.

> What is the core spec (based on the MVP)— What are the problems we need to handle, What are the edge cases, and What the tricky part is.

## Breaking down a complex problem framework

This might be overkill for most exercise, but is a good way I found for breaking down a complex problem by dividing it into parts, phases and identifying crucial points. And could be useful if narrowing down the scope doesn't come easy straight off the bat.
