# Network communication

1. For data updates in real-time web applications, there are three ways:
    - Long/short **Poll**ing (client pull) — For stocks application
    - **WebSockets** (server push)—For chat application
    - Server-Sent Events, server push (**SSE**) —For stocks application

2. Backend for FrontEnd(**BFF**) — API aggregatingThe BFF will do the following:

- Call the relevant microservices APIs and obtain the needed data
- Format the data based on the frontend representation
- Send the formatted data to the frontend

3. **GraphQL** — It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need

4. **Caching / HTTP2** — caching get APIs
