# Sorting fundamentals

understanding general concepts behind them 

eg why quick sort and merge sort are faster then bubble sort.

They might ask the run time of a sorted array and unsorted

Sorting is `O(n long n)` eg for quick sort and merge sort in the average case.

Eg you are going to use sort in the algo in your language, but being able to factor in O complexity of sort operation in the context of the overall algorithm 

Eg algo O(nÂ²) then sorting algo is negligible

but is algo overall is O(n) then sorting might have made it worste.
