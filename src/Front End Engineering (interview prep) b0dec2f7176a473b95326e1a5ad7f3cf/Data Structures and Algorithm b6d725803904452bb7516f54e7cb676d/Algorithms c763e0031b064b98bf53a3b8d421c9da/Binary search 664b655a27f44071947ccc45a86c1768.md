# Binary search

Know how to implement binary search 

## Pseudo code

Looking for an integer in a sorted list of integers. 

Middle one

is it smaller. Then don't look at bigger once.

...

## Examples where it might come up

eg in a list of git commits, find the one that has got a specific thing associated with it.

## Time complexity

Time complexity binary search, O (Log n) because at every step you eliminate half of the list.

## Quick sort

Quick sort, similar to binary search. 

sorting algorithm. Pick a random number, set it as pivot, then this divides the array in half. Take a look at that half and re-do that.

similar logic to binary search
