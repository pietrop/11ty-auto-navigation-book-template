# Variables/Pointers manipulation

How to manipulate multiple variables/Pointers at once.

eg Traversing a string, in parallel, from left to right, and from right to left.

Manipulating multiple pointers, two pointers, to different variables at once.

Sometimes traversing a linked list with two pointers, eg one faster ahead then the other, for some reason.

## Palindrome

eg find longest palindromic substring in a string

Traverse full string, and for every letter/char, you start out two pointers, compare the other char outwards, and when/if they differ, reset and move on to next char
