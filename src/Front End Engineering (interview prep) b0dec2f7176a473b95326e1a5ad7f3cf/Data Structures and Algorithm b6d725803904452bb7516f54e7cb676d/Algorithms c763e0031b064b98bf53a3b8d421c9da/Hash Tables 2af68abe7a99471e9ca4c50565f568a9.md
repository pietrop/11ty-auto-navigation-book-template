# Hash Tables

## Traversing a matrix

eg a matrix, two dimensional array, visit, traverse it, eg depth first way. And keep track of what you have visited. Eg the longest amount of zeros next to each other.

Hash table to make sure you don't revisit grid coordinates.

## find numbers in array

Keep track numbers in an array, to find two numbers that sum up to something 

## Cache values

nth fibonacci number, in fibonacci sequence. 

Eg store values that you have already computed.

Dynamic programming, memoization, caching. 

Fibonacci of 10 === fibonacci of 9 + fibonacci of 8

cache the values

Hash table helps support, create the caching. 

But sometimes you can use the an array, and the keys are just the indices of the array.
