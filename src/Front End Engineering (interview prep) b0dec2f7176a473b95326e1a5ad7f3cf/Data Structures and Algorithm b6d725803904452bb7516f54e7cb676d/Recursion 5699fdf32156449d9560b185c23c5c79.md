# Recursion

Rarely seen in production code.

Lends itself well for certain algo. 

requires use of data structures.

Two parts

1. What do you do at every single iteration
Cases to end recursion (base case)
2. recursive calls you are going to make.

You can implement depth first search as recursion 

```jsx
function countdown(count) {
  if (count > 0) {
    console.log(count)
    return countdown(count - 1)
  } else {
    return count
  }
}

countdown(5)
```

from [https://coderrocketfuel.com/article/recursion-in-react-render-comments-with-nested-children](https://coderrocketfuel.com/article/recursion-in-react-render-comments-with-nested-children) 

variation, eg if you want to accumulate the results

```jsx
// As an explnanation 
// we can use default parameter to initialize
// the array accumulator on first call
// then it keeps being passed down the recursion
// in subsequent calls until it's returned.
function countdown(count, result=[]) {
  if (count > 0) {
    result.push(count)
    return countdown(count - 1, result)
  } else {
    return result;
  }
}

countdown(5)
```

Eg fibonacci and factorial
