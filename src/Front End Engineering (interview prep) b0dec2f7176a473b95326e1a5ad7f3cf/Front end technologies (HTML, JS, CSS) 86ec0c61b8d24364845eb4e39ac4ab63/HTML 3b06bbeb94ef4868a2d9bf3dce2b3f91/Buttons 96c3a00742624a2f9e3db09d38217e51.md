# Buttons

Also see Btns in accessibility section

**TL;DR**: Use buttons, and style them accordingly, don't use `div` or `a` .
*Read on for reasons behind this*

> **Warning:** Be careful when marking up links with the button role. Buttons are expected to be triggered using the `Space` or `Enter` key, while links are expected to be triggered using the `Enter` key. In other words, when links are used to behave like buttons, adding `role="button"` alone is not sufficient. It will also be necessary to add a key event handler that listens for the `Space` key in order to be consistent with native buttons.
