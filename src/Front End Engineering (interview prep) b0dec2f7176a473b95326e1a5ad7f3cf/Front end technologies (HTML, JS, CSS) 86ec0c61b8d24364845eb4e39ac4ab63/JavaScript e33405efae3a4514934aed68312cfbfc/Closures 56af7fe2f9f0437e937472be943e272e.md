> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function‚Äôs scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

## On the downside of using closure as a pattern

> It is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions if closures are not needed for a particular task, as it will negatively affect script performance both in terms of processing speed and memory consumption.
For instance, when creating a new object/class, methods should normally be associated to the object's prototype rather than defined into the object constructor. The reason is that whenever the constructor is called, the methods would get reassigned (that is, for every object creation).

## Questions

```jsx
let number;
for (var i=0; i<5;i++){
	number = i;
	setTimeout(function(){
	console.log(number)
	}, 1000)
}

// 4 x5 - prints 4 five times
```

```jsx
for (var i=0; i<5;i++){
	setTimeout(function(){
	console.log(i)
	}, 1000)
}

// 5 x5 - prints 5 five times
```

Changing `var` to `let` fixes the loop and it prints `0,1,2,3,4`
