# Inheritance

```css
font-weight: inherit;
```

```css
font-weight: initial;
```

> The unset property behaves differently if a property is inheritable or not. If a property is inheritable, the unset keyword will be the same as inherit. If the property is not inheritable, the unset keyword is equal to initial.

```css
margin: unset;
color: unset;
```
