# Pseudo classes & pseudo elements

[Pseudo-classes - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)

> A **pseudo-class** is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer.

> **Pseudo-elements** behave in a similar way, however they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements. Pseudo-elements start with a double colon `::`.

> A **pseudo-element** is a 'fake' element, it isn't really in the document with the 'real' ones. **Pseudo-classes** are like 'fake' classes that are applied to elements under certain conditions, much like how you would manipulate the classes of elements using JavaScript.

pseudo elements starts with `::`

pseudo classes starts with `:` and they are appended to another element (?)
