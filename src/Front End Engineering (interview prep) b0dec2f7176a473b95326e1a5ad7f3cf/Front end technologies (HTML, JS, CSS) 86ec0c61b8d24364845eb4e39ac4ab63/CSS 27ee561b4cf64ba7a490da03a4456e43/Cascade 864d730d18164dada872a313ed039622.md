# Cascade

How the cascade affects attributes.

> **Position and order of appearance:** the order of which your CSS rules appear

**Specificity**: an algorithm which determines which CSS selector has the strongest match

**Origin**: the order of when CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS

**Importance**: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the `!important` rule type
