# box-sizing

[box-sizing - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing)

> By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:
width + padding + border = actual width of an element

> The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

[CSS Box Sizing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp)

> This alternative box model tells CSS to apply the `width` to the border box instead of the content box. This means that our `border` and padding get pushed in, and as a result, when you set `.my-box` to be `200px` wide: it actually renders at `200px` wide.
