# Float

> If you have an image that sits within a paragraph of text, wouldn't it be handy for that text to wrap around that image like you might see in a newspaper? You can do this with floats.

> The float property instructs an element to "float" to the direction specified. The image in this example is instructed to float left, which then allows sibling elements to "wrap" around it. You can instruct an element to float `left`, `right` or `inherit`.

```css
img {
	float: left;
	margin-right: 1em;
}
```

> **Floats** — Applying a `[float](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float)` value such as `left` can cause block level elements to wrap alongside one side of an element, like the way images sometimes have text floating around them in magazine layouts.
