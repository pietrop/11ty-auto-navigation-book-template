# Display (property)

Block or inline 

> Inline elements behave like words in a sentence. They sit next to each other in the inline direction. Elements such as `<span>` and `<strong>`, which are typically used to style pieces of text within containing elements like a `<p>` (paragraph), are inline by default. They also preserve surrounding whitespace.

```css
display: inline
```

> Block elements don't sit alongside each other. They create a new line for themselves. Unless changed by other CSS code, a block element will expand to the size of the inline dimension, therefore spanning the full width in a horizontal writing mode. The margin on all sides of a block element will be respected.

```css
display: block
```
