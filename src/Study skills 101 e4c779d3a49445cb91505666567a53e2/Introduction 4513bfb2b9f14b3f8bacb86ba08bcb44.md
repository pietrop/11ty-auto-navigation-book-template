# Introduction

Learning, studying , writing is all as much about learning the techniques and working out what works best for you, as it is about researching and learning a new subject.

My overall objective is to show you techniques, and give you an understanding of the practices and processes to minimize your overall effort, so that you can focus your energy on the key steps that make a difference, and therefore maximize your results.

I will cover Active Reading Techniques, note taking, note making, research techniques,

This comes from a series of presentation done to the MA Documentary Films  students at the London College of Communication on digital study skills.

Prior to that I’ve been working as IT Study Skills tutor for university students entitled to DSA support. These experience has given me a  chance to research and consolidate best practice techniques and test them on a variety of students, and therefore a variety of learning styles.
