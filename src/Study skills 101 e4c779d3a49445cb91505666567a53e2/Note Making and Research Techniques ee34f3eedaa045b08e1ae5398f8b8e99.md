# **Identify your resources**

## **Coursework essay**

First thing first, you need to identify your research resources, if you are writing a coursework essay you are going to have a reading list you want to look at.

This is generally grouped by topics and divided into core readings and further readings. Core readings are those that should give you an overview of the topic, and further readings usually go into details on a specific aspect of the topic.

it’s a good idea to start with identifying the core readings to get a have a good starting point to get a good understanding of the topic.

if it helps you could make a concept map/diagram where you map out the taxonomy(classification system) of how the books are positioned in relation to each other [?]

### **Research & Google Reader**

if you are doing some other type of writing based on some sort of research.

For more current affairs/News, internet based research, where you need to keep up to date with the latest updates, and your sources are mostly blogs, news websites, and similar.. then Google Reader is your tool, it allows to create a searchable database that self update itself with the latest releases.

Collecting and added the RSS Feed of the relevant news sources, to the system allows you to search them for keywords/sentences and helps you very quickly to narrow down what’s relevant.
