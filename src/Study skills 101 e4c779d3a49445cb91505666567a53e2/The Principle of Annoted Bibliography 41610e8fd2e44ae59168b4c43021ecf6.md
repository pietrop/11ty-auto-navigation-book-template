concept of annoted bibliography.

# **Cornell Method for note taking part 2**

# **Digital Tools**

### **Zotero annoted bibliography**

**PROBLEM,**

However this is all very well, but leaves you with 3 problems,doesnʼt it?

1: How do u handle all the bulk of reading material ?

For instance if u got 5 books, 100 to 300 pages each, do u read the whole book? coz if so uʼd better start now... plus uʼll need to select these 5 from another 10 books a round the same length to decide which one is really relevant for your essay question...

2: extrapolating effective notes from the readings,and how to organise them? 3: how to handle the bibliography effectively?
