# **Active Reading Techniques**

The only prerequisite to understand this section on active reading techniques,  is the awareness that there is a fundamental difference between reading a book as a novel and reading it for essay writing.

weʼll look into the anatomy of text & structure of books what different information you can expect find in the Introduction & in the Conclusion of a book.

How a paragraph structured (PEC=Point Expand Comment).

Understanding and mastering reading skills is useful for “writing skills”.

We are going to start by looking at paragraph as the building block of a text.

**Anatomy of a paragraph.**

**Paragraph as a unit of concept**

**1 paragraph == 1 idea**

Is usefull to think of a a paragraph as a unit of concept. A paragraph = 1 idea.

A typical “best practice” paragraph will have 3 elements, which is the PEC structure: Point, Expand. Comment. it’s important to note thou, that when you are writing down ideas as they are forming into your head you shouldn t let this framework block you, you should just draft them down, and then see in a later stage how to redraft them into this framework. we’ll see a workflow at a later stage.

This is a neat way of organizing your text, that also helps the clarity of thinking.

**Anatomy of a Paragraph: PEC**

Point, is the topic sentence. in one sentence you can state the main idea that you are going to explain in the paragraph.

Expand either present explanations or  definitions, clarifying difficult or unclear terms.

and/ or  provide evidence, to support or that develop the main idea of the paragraph.

and/or comments to support or develop the evidence with more information, including or contrasting points.

you need to to use all of these 3 elements in every paragraph thou.

Comment,  is where you explain why you use whatever you wrote in the expand section(for instance a citation ) to back up your original point and/or relates the citation to the main point that the paragraph wants to make, stated in the topic sentce.

The comment could also conclude with a sentence that leads to the next paragraph.

# **Anatomy of a Book**

## **Visual Structure of a text trough layout: Pointers, headings etc.**

### **Principle**

The Layout of a text gives us a lot of information towards the information it contains. Are there bullet points? how many times does it indent? are there line between paragraphs? are there headings?

How is the text organized/presented helps you to map out where you are going to find the information you are looking for.

### **Thinks to look out for actively surveying a book**

![Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%201.png](Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%201.png)

This is one way of doing, you look at and read the  Cover, Back-cover, and index.

Then you go to the Conclusion and read the last and first paragraph. Once you done with that, go to  the introduction, again only first and last paragraph.

Now if you feel a bit confused, and find it useful, you can take A4 paper, and with the information you have from this step you can map out or write in as a diagram or as an outline or however works best for you. The information you have gathered from this first round of surveying the text, and also what you expect to find in the book. This reasoning on the expectations, gives you something to actively look for in the next round, and also engages you with the text, to start the active reading.

Now you are ready to survey the most relevant/interesting chapter and read topic/first sentence and last sentence of each paragraph, you have “mapped the text”, (even if it might be just in your head) and have enough information to decide what to concentrate on and what’s most relevant for your essay, if nothing is, no worries, move on to the next book and start over.

### Pointers & Organizers

Another Interesting aspect to survey text is to look at “organizers” in it. These allow you to infer information about the content looking at how it has been structured. Organizers are: such as numbers, letters, steps, or the words, first, second, or next. Look for words that are bold faced, italics, or in a different font size, style, or color. Headings, and subheadings. Sometimes the author will put key ideas in the margin. it is basicly mainly dictate by the formatting, but is also pointers in the text.

Pointers are [...] Headings and subheadins, these are usefull to read trough, but also to turn them into questions, to make hypothesis about what that section of text will be about. Identify what to look for in that section.

Lists, can be bullet points, or numbered, however main think to look for is what are they listing? which is usually stated in the last sentece just before the list.

Indents […] gives you an idea of how many paragraph there are in each section. And therefore the density of content you can expect.

### Using PEC for Reading

**Reading trough Topic Sentence: to get an overview**

Let’s look at one way of reading trough  a book without reading every single page in it from beginning to end and still get a good grasp of the overall content of the text, and where information are in it.

This is done trough reading only the topic sentence, the first line of every paragraph, of a chapter or book.

![Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%203.png](Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%203.png)

Try a open a book at a random page, read only the topic sentence, and then close it and see what you got out of it.

as you can imagine you can read a all chapter like this.

**Reading trough Comment sentence**

reading trough topic sentences, sometimes might not give you enough information, reading the last sentence of the paragraph as well might shed some light.

![Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%205.png](Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%205.png)

as for the previous you extend this to a whole chapter.

![Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%206.png](Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%206.png)

( if you are not getting enough meaning from the topic sentences and or the text is too complex, then read also the last sentence of every or most paragraphs )

![Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%207.png](Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%207.png)

once you have narrowed down where is the information you need, trough scanning and skimming, youʼll know page numbers and books that are relevants.

then u can use SQ3R for reading and comprehension

This is a reading and comprehension technique, with time people that use it interiorize it and do it without thinking about it.

However if you are aware of it, you can use it if you feel a particular author is being cryptic or hard to see what itʼs talking about.

## Scan Reading and skim reading

![Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%208.png](Active%20reading%20604492cde74e48ec8018f4928c72dc4a/Untitled%208.png)

This is another technique, if you feel a bit more confident, to survey a text, but let’s look at the difference between skimming and scanning

Scan Reading : to identify if a text is relevant. Looking trough the page for ideas, words, or phrases that answers questions you have decided might be answered int he text,without reading everything. It can be used to determined weather, a book, a chapter, or an article are relevant for your research and/or essay.

Skim Reading : to quickly identify main idea of a text, Skimming is done at a speed three to four times faster than normal reading. generally you would do so by moving your eyes every 2 or 3 words and seeing the words in between slightly of focus.
