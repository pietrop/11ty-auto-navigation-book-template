# Exposure triangle

Aesthetics and Reciprocity of the Exposure triangle: Aperture, Shutter, ISO.

### **The main things that can be controlled to do with the exposure triangle, to set the aesthetics of a picture are: Shallow or Greater Depth of field, Freeze or blur motion. Or even combine this two sets of variables.**

### **Trough setting Aperture first you can set a Shallow or a Greater Depth of field,**

Aperture

Prioratising Aperture, for Shallow or Greater Depth of field eg Portrait vs landscape

f2 - 1/1000

f8 - 1/8

f22 - 1/6

They give all the same exposure.

Shutter Speed

While Prioritising Shutter speed you can decide weather you want to Freeze or blur motion

However 1/500 f3.5 freezes motion,

while 1/15  f20 blurs motion.

Iso

when one of these settings doesn't allow to set the other one to obtain the wanted result, you can adjust the ISO as last resort to accommodate the aesthetic you are trying to achieve.
