# Focal Length  & field of view

**View Point**: Is the position we take the photography from. Also the position you place the viewer in, when they are looking at your finished image.

**Field of view:** How much of the scene will be captured, measured as an angle from the view point. Eg 180° from Fisheye lens all the way to 12° (like a 135mm) and narrower for telephoto. (see diagram below)

**Focal length:**  The distance, in millimetres, between the optical centre of the lens and the camera’s sensor (or film plane). Lenses are named by their focal length. Eg 50mm.

Zoom lenses are named by the focal length range they can cover eg 24-70mm.
****Focal length (f) and field of view (FOV) of a lens are inversely proportional. (Higher the focal length, lower the field of view. Eg 8mm 180degrees, 135mm 12 degrees)

> Without getting into an in-depth physics discussion, the focal length of a lens is an optical property of the lens. It measures the distance, in millimetres, between the optical centre of the lens and the camera’s sensor (or film plane). It is determined with the camera focused to infinity. Lenses are named by their focal length, and you can find this information on the barrel of the lens. For example, a 50 mm lens has a focal length of 50 mm

[What Is Focal Length in Photography?](https://photographylife.com/what-is-focal-length-in-photography)

> Lens focal length tells us the **angle of view**—how much of the scene will be captured—and the **magnification**—how large individual elements will be. 

The longer the focal length, the narrower the angle of view and the higher the magnification. The shorter the focal length, the wider the angle of view and the lower the magnification.

Eg in the diagram below, a 16mm focal length has a 84 degrees angle of view.

# Relationship between Focal Length & field of view

increasing the focal length, decreases the field of view

Changing the focal length versus changing the viewpoint.

> moving forward while shortening the focal length lets you keep objects at one depth the same size

> n cinematography, this is called the dolly-zoom,
or “Vertigo effect”, after Alfred Hitchcock’s movie

TODO: find clip

Todo: clip picture example two subjects on different plane, shown as side by side by telephoto vs shown further apart by wider lens.

Effect of focal length on portraits

- ✦ standard “portrait lens” is 85mm

TODO: Example on wide, standard, telephoto. Distortion on portrait.

# Lenses Focal Length

Most likely on zoom. But it helps to understand the effect to chose which lens one to use it more deliberately.

Notes: Less about using zoom to frame, but more about composition (?)

Notes: separate section on Implication for portraits (with examples, portrait with wide, medium, tele, separation of background, flat vs distorted etc...)

## Fish Eye

8-15mm

## Wide

15-35 mm

Tends to create a curved distortion at the edges. 

For portraits 

Watch out for distortion at the edgers but also centered if too close to the subject. 

Generally not suitable for “Head crop” (todo: find actual name )

More suitable for “busto shot”(todo: find actually make) or full body shot.

35mm and sometimes 28mm(eg Ricoh GR) are common in street photography.

As well as 40mm (eg Canon Pancake lens) - common for street photography.

## Normal

Standard focal length.

Closer to how we see.

Common with street photography and portrait.

Still a little distortion for tight face portraits tho.

50 mm

## Tele photo

Creates a magnification effect.

Flattens/compress the space - foreground and background.

Background blur.

Up to 200 range common for portraits 

Higher telephoto common for sports and wildlife photography.

80-100 range good for portraits. 

Eg 85 is quiet common for portraits. 

Some common values 

> 60mm  

85mm

100mm

200mm 
300mm

etc..

## Zoom lenses

Roughly most common combo across brands in 35mm sensor 

- 15-35mm f2.8 or f4
- 24-70mm f2.8 or 24-105 f4
- 70-200mm f2.8 or 70-200 f4
- And other telephoto zooms for sport, wildlife etc.. eg 100-500mm or 100-600mm. Generally with variable aperture.
- Telephoto often have a x1.4 or x1.8 or x2 adapter that increases the focal length at cost of reducing maximum aperture of the lens.

See teleconverter page. (Todo: add link)

## Macro lenses

very close focusing distance 

Provides magnification higher then what human eye can see.

eg 100mm macro

Common for certain type of Wildlife photography eg insects and small animals as well as flowers and product photography like jewelry and accessories.
