# Depth of field

understanding factors that influence depth of field.

## 1. Aperture

As seen above, lower number, ie f2 wider aperture , shallower depth of field

## 2. focal length

ie at 100mm, tele end of zoom lens, is more accentuated than at the wider end, eg 24mm.

## 3. Distance

relative distance to subject.

1. first of all if possible zoom in
2. then get camera closer to the subject
3. and align so that the object and background further away.

f4.5 - 1/30 - 140mm -Iso 100 - Canon G12

# **For all in focus (greater depth of field)**

Do the opposite,

- f11 or higher.
- and if possible limit background.

Useful for landscapes.
