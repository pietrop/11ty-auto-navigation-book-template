# Silhouette effect

position yourself opposite to the subject and the external light source, with light source behind the subject. ie sun.

- set camera to spot meetering.(this reads 1% of the frame only where the red dot is)
- meter on the sky/light source, and set aperture and shutter to get camera lightmeter to zero or lower.
- frame subject and focus, without chaning other settings, and there you go it should be a silouette.
