# Fv - Flexible priority exposure mode

[EOS R Quick Tips: Flexible-priority Exposure Mode](https://youtu.be/qzSufGpn59E)

Fv operations 

> The beauty of Fv mode, unlike P mode, is that the rear thumb dial can be used to toggle between shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation and ISO, with the top dial (the one just behind the shutter and M-Fn button) allowing you to adjust whichever exposure variable you’d like.

Resetting one setting to auto 

> With the camera set to its factory-default settings, quickly returning aperture back to fully automatic is simply a case of pressing the top four-way directional pad button

Resetting all settings to auto 

> If you suddenly decide that you want to revert multiple settings you’ve taken off auto back to full auto operation, this is also possible. Simply touch the right four-way controller button and you’ll notice how aperture, shutter speed and ISO all return to full auto.
