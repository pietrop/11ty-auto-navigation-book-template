# Light meter

Understanding and using the light meter

on a dslr looks like this, on a pro-compact (ie G12) it's horizontal rather then vertical.

When you half press the shutter to focus lock, the curson moves and shows wheather the picture is over exposed (+1 to +2) or under exposed (-1 to -2).

Rule of thumb: aim to set at -1, under expose by one stop. (?)

## How to use light meter:

### 1- point camera at subject

set exposure to

**evaluative metering**

### 2- Check

**light meter by**

half pressing the shutter to focus lock.

and see if camera

**light meter**

shows you to be over or under exposed.

Then set Shutter and Aperture, to get light meter to zero.

### 3. priorities changing Shutter or Aperture (over ISO)

Depending on whether your primary objective is freezing / blurring action OR Shallow / Greater depth of field, set first the shutter OR the Aperture and adjust the  other one accordingly to balance the light meter to zero.

### 3.1 Adjust **shutter**

. (on DSLR front wheel)

- ie not lower then 1/60 for hand held,
- higher then 1/250 for freezing action,
- between 1/20 and 1/10 for blurred effect ie panning effect.

### 3.2  Adjust **aperture**

. (on DSLr Back Wheel)

- set F2 for shallow depth of field (blurred background)
- set higher f stop, like f16 or higher for greater depth of field (everything in focus)

### 4 Adjust **Iso**

- have it at 100
- but as a last resort if light meter, stil under exposed, set ISO to center the light meter to zero.
