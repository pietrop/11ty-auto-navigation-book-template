# Shutter Speed

Amount of time the shutter is open.

ie range on 5D MK1 is 30" to 1/8000 sec

1/1000 is faster then 1/30.

## **Faster Shutter**

freezes action. and it's relative to the speed of the action.

ie 1/125 someone walking.

ie 1/1000 formula one.

ie water 1/1000

to the extent of capturing things the human eye can't see, with such clarity, ie a drop. (1/8 000 of a sec)

## **Slow Shutter**

speeds makes motion blurred.

1" 1/4 1/15  1/30

when you reach the camera limits you can ad an ND filter, and that gives you a couple of f stops more. (it's equivalent of sunglasses for a camera).

ie for  capturing blurred flow of water on a river.

ie to get lighting, exposure of 20 to 30 seconds.

or a more creative use of slow shutter speed is for instance if you fire flash at end, you can have the tiral of someone running.

if you want to go even slower, there is a

## **bulb**

function that allows you open and close the shutter manually, if you want to go for even longer exposures time then the one available.

ie f2.8 , 3.5hour iso 40 , 17mm lens

Whole, half and third shutter speed
