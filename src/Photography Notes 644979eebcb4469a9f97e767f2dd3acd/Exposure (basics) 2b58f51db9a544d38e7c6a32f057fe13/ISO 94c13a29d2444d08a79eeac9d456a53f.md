# ISO

It's the density of the pixels. it comes from when on film you had to chose different rols of films depending on the aviability of light you were forecasting for the shoot, and they would have thicker or wider space between the celluloid.

at Iso 100 the pixelles are packed togethere, and is harder for the light to get trough.

at iso 1600 pixells are further apart, better for low light, but pourer quality, los of clour and sharpnees.

as RGB, colour scheme, Red, Green and Blue pixells, pulls apart at higher iso.

Rule of thumb: Keep ISO as low as possible. ISO 100 is idea, to be used at all time, but if lower light and already adjuster shutter and Aperture, you can go higher with the ISO.

Generally for studio photography and portraits it would be 100 or 200 max, while for photojournalism you can go higher if circumstances require as it doesn't matter as much.

TODO: idea of usable ISO number before grain is introduced on your camera.
