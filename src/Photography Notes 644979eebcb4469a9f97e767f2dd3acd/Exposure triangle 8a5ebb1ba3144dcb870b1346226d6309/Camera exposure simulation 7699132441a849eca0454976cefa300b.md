# Camera exposure simulation

if you are still puzzled about the exposure triangle and using the light meter to set exposure, there is a camera simulator app 

which is worth giiving it a try to test out the exposure triangle (Aperture, Shutter, ISO) in relation to understanding and using the light meter, to set exposure correctly.

You can change shutter speed and aperture accordingly to try out the blurred and freeze action effect.
